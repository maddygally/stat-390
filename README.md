# stat-390 Presentation 4

"Teams 1, 3, 4, 5: Noah's algorithm seems to do well on matching slices across stains. Other people have used similar ideas, but Noah's algorithm is very well organized and automated. It even works on tough cases like patient 155 (Sheffield). Test out the algorithm rigorously, identify cases where it fails, and then think of ideas to fix it. Team 1 has tried a comprehensive set of methods (check the spreadsheet) that may be used to fix any potential failures of Noah's algorithm. Don't use ORB or histogram methods. If you strongly feel that your idea is better than Noah's algorithm, you are free to work on it."


We worked on testing Noah's algorithm as a team, communicating and playing to each other's strengths.

Andrew: Was confident in the cosine similarity method, and continued to tweak it.

Ally: Tested Noah's algorithm on 38 patients and made adjustments to fix some issues, edited the separate.py script. Counting successes and failures.

Diego: Researched methods to fix the algorithm and worked with Maddy to make a new algorithm; Ally in identifying successes and failures with Noah's Algorithm

Emma: Researched methods with Diego in communication with Maddy, and assisted Ally in identifying successes and failures with Noah's Algorithm

Maddy: Improved Noah's separate algorithm using adaptive thresholding to better identify the sox-10 and Melan-A stains, which led to more accurate slices.
