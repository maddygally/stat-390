# What we have so far

Here, we manually identified the hexcodes for the stroma, and input them to QuPath so it would recognize the stroma as that shade of light pink.

Here, we estimated stain vectors, based on a selected square of the provided image. QuPath automatically creates subplots containing each pixel, showing the relationship for each RGB relationship in each pixel. Along the end, QuPath created stain vectors, and used that to identify melanocytes

Here, we ran QuPath to automatically detect cells, in this case melanocytes.

Here, the melanocyte can be identified manually, we later coded to identify them automatically, and did so across many images:

## Low-Grade C-MIL using H&E

## High-Grade C-MIL using H&E

## Benign using H&E

## High-Grade C-MIL - Melan-A

## Low-Grade C-MIL - Melan-A

## Benign -Melan-A

Andrew and Emma worked on the code below, as well as some data cleaning that is not included . They went for a preliminary approach using R, while we played with QuPath

```{r}
#| eval: false

library(magick)


target_rgb <- c(r = 0.651, g = 0.701, b = 0.29)
tolerance <- 0.05


is_close <- function(color) {
  all(abs(color - target_rgb) <= tolerance)
}


image_path <- "path/to/your/image.jpg"  
image <- image_read(image_path)

image_matrix <- as.integer(image_data(image))

mask <- matrix(FALSE, nrow = dim(image_matrix)[1], ncol = dim(image_matrix)[2])

# Iterate over each pixel and check if it's close to the target RGB
for (i in 1:dim(image_matrix)[1]) {
  for (j in 1:dim(image_matrix)[2]) {
    pixel_rgb <- image_matrix[i, j, 1:3] / 255  # Normalize to [0, 1]
    if (is_close(pixel_rgb)) {
      mask[i, j] <- TRUE
    }
  }
}

output_image <- image
output_image[!mask] <- "white"  

image_write(output_image, "output_image.jpg")  
print(output_image)  
```

# Going forward

We brainstormed a few ideas for next steps:

-   Identify the border of each melanocyte and classify the thickness or presence of it's white outline

-   Identify the concentration of melanocytes in a given area away from the edge of the epithelium.

-   Code the epithelium into quarters and see how many melanocytes have traveled away from the stroma

    -   In better words, the concentration of melanocytes in each quarter.
